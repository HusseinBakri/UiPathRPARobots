## Software Robot 1 - solution of the famous RPA challenge
This robot solves the famous [RPA challenge ](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap). It uses a set of Anchors to find the textboxes when they change with each addition. You do not have to do anything just run. Please also make sure you install the UiPath Firefox extension so that the RPA can communicate with Firefox.
