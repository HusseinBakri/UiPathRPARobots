# UiPathRPARobots
A set of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) robots created in [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) to automate some useful tasks. If you are a newbie to RPA, you can find some information in this [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/robotic-process-automation-rpa.asp). For more information on UiPath, you can check out [these tutorials](https://www.uipath.com/developers/video-tutorials).

This repository contains several RPA robots that I have developed. I will keep uploading more. I am currently working on a robot that backup all my emails and attachments from Outlook so I will add it also here.

# The content

## Software Robot 1 - Solution of the famous RPA challenge
This robot solves the famous [RPA challenge](http://www.rpachallenge.com/). It uses a set of Anchors to find the textboxes when they change with each addition. You do not have to do anything other than just run it. Please also make sure you install the UiPath Firefox extension so that the RPA can communicate with Mozilla Firefox.

If you want to choose Google Chrome, make sure you change that in the UiPath Open browser activity.

## Software Robot 2 - PDF Documents Scraper


## Software Robot 3 - Scraping Scanned PDFs using OCR
